# Kotlin-FIrebase-Login-Page
My introduction with Firebase and Kotlin language for android application development.In this project I created a login page for the tic tac toe game.In this I used the email authentiation facility provided by Google Firebase.The user logs in to play the game.This is the first time I used firebase after switching from Parse.
